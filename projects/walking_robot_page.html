            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The inception of the walking robot project was driven by a fundamental question - "Can robots walk?" This venture aimed to explore the feasibility of creating a walking robot using Arduino microcontrollers and servo motors. The primary goal was to develop a functional walking mechanism that imitates human walking patterns.</p>

            <h2>Used Technologies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The project utilized Arduino microcontrollers as the core computing unit and servo motors for controlling the robot's movements. The Arduino platform offered a versatile and programmable environment, enabling precise control of the servo motors to simulate walking motions.</li>
                
            </ul>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The project delved into the realm of robotics to examine the practicality of robot locomotion, specifically walking. By employing Arduino microcontrollers and servo motors, the team aimed to replicate human walking patterns in a mechanical form. This involved programming the Arduino to regulate the servo motors' actions, emulating the bipedal movement observed in humans. The endeavor emphasized experimentation and exploration, aiming to demonstrate the possibility of robot locomotion resembling natural human gait through simple yet effective mechanisms.</p>
